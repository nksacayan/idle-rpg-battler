TODO:
	Go refactor health to be a more generic stat, then use it to start implementing battle character
	Big character stat refactor to simplify with dicts
	
NOTES:
	At all times try to decouple components. Strive for dependency injection, and make the injector
	a different object than the guy who needs the dependencies
