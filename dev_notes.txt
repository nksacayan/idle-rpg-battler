TODO:
- Figure out how to add default starter commands so i can retest battle UI
- Had to do big UI refactor on the way to character details page in order to do commands
- Refactor UI providers and components: Providers don't actually need saved scenes just use the script

Future stuff:
- Convert battle stats, especially character resources etc 
  to real resources and use them for the idle stage. Would be a big stat refactor
- Have some commands work in battle but also have commands that have effects in the idle stage?
